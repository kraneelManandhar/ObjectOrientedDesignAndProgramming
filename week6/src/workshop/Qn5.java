//5.	Complex Assertion with assertAll
//Write a class Product with fields name (String), price (double), and quantity (int). Write a method isAffordable(double budget) that returns true if the total price (price * quantity) is less than
//or equal to the given budget. Write a JUnit test that:
//●	Verifies that the name is not null.
//●	Verifies that the price is a positive value.
//●	Verifies that the isAffordable() method works correctly with different budgets using assertAll.
